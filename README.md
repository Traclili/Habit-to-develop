HabitToDevelop is an iOS app to help monitor habits and keep the user on track of tasks and resolutions in order to boost productivity.

This app uses a system of points and rewards to motivate the user to complete tasks and follow healthy habits. It rewards points when the user accomplishes a task on a To-Do list or follows a healthy habit. These points can be used to earn 'rewards' that the user can add in the rewards section, such as watching TV or going out for lunch. This app can also track resolutions that the user has added. Users can see their past accomplishments and rewards through the history tab of the app, and users can save their points in a savings tab to save up for bigger rewards.
